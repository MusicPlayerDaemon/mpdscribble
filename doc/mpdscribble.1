.SH NAME
mpdscribble - A Music Player Daemon (MPD) client which submits
information about tracks being played to a scrobbler (e.g. last.fm).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mpdscribble [options] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mpdscribble
is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. mpdscribble connects to
an MPD running on the local network and works in parallel with other
MPD clients on the network.

By default it will get the hostname and port for mpd from the MPD_HOST 
and MPD_PORT environment variables. mpdscribble will use localhost:6600 
if those are not set. The hostname and port can also be specified in the
configuration file or on the command line. 

$ mpdscribble \-\-host myhost \-\-port=12345

Values specified on the command line override values from the configuration 
file or environment variables.

If you want to use mpdscribble with a password-protected MPD, set the 
environment variable MPD_HOST to password@host, or specify the host in the
configuration file similarly.

On submission failure, mpdscribble waits for some time then retries. Sending a
USR1 signal to a running mpdscribble process makes it submit immediately.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display help and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-no-daemon
Don't daemonize mpdscribble, run it in foreground.
.TP
.B \-\-pidfile FILE
Write the process id to this file.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon-user USERNAME
Change to this system user after daemonization.
.TP
.B \-\-log FILE
Specify log file.  The special value "syslog" makes mpdscribble use
the local syslog daemon (which is the default).  "-" means log to
stderr.
.TP
.B \-\-conf FILE
Read configuration options from file. /etc/mpdscribble.conf
is used by default (if \-\-sysconfdir=/etc).
.TP
.B \-\-host [PASSWORD@]HOSTNAME
Specify host protected by password. 
To connect via Unix Domain Socket, specify an absolute path here.
.TP
.B \-\-port PORT
Specify which port the MPD listens on.
.TP
.B \-\-proxy URL
HTTP proxy URL.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose LEVEL
Specify how verbosely mpdscribble should log.  Possible values are 0
to 3, defaulting to 1.
.SH CONFIGURATION
mpdscribble looks for its configuration file in the following order:
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf, ~/.config/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf, ~/.mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf, /etc/mpdscribble.conf
(if \-\-sysconfdir=/etc)
but this can be overridden by specifying an alternate configuration
file using the command line option
\-\-conf.

Supported configuration options:
.TP
.B pidfile = FILE
Write the process id to this file.
.TP
.B log = FILE
The file to which mpdscribble should output debugging information.
The special value "syslog" makes mpdscribble use the local syslog
daemon (which is the default).  "-" means log to stderr.
.TP
.B host = [PASSWORD@]HOSTNAME
The host running MPD, possibly protected by a password.
To connect via Unix Domain Socket, specify an absolute path here.
.TP
.B port = PORT
The port that the MPD listens on and mpdscribble should try to connect to.
.TP
.B proxy = URL
HTTP proxy URL.
.TP
.B verbose = 0, 1, 2, 3
How verbose mpdscribble's logging should be.  Default is 1.  "0" means
log only critical errors (e.g. "out of memory"); "1" also logs
non-critical errors (e.g. "server unreachable"); "2" logs
informational messages (e.g. "new song"); "3" prints a lot of
debugging messages.
.SH SCROBBLERS
These options are followed by at least one scrobbler section (choose a
unique section name like "libre.fm" which only appears in the log
file; the name "mpdscribble" is reserved).
.TP
.B file = PATH
Log to a file instead of submitting the songs to an AudioScrobbler
server.
.TP
.B url = URL
The handshake URL of the scrobbler.  Example:
"https://post.audioscrobbler.com/", "http://turtle.libre.fm/"
.TP
.B username = USERNAME
Your audioscrobbler username.
.TP
.B password = MD5SUM
Your Last.fm password, either cleartext or its MD5 sum.
.TP
.B journal = FILE
The file where mpdscribble should store its journal in case you do not
have a connection to the scrobbler.  This option used to be called
"cache".  It is optional.
